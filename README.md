`What does it bring?`
TTCV2 extension is the based on the [Classic TankTrouble] (https://classic.tanktrouble.com/), very fist version of this beautiful game called [TankTrouble] (https://tanktrouble.com/). As the time passed TankTrouble improved alot. Each upgrade brought something new to it. As the upgrades were happening, Classic TankTrouble got completely replaced. Fear of losing such it forever. I have made something this extension to bring back that nostalgic game back to life. Bringing back old but gold textures, graphics, UI and much much much more.... Let me show you how did TankTrouble looked like back in the old days!
